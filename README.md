Makma is a Vulkan benchmark. It features a four-pass deferred renderer, cascaded shadow mapping, metal/roughness material setup, volumetric lighting, bloom, directional, point and spotlights, in-depth performance graphs (per pass) and a large options menu to customize the benchmark.

**NOTE**: Building Makma requires the Vulkan SDK to be installed. It was last built with Vulkan 1.2.170.
