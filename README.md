```diff
- NOTE: You need to build Makma against SDL (version 2.0.8), assimp (version 3.1.1) and the LunarG Vulkan SDK
- (version 1.1.73.0). If you are using Visual Studio, you need to modify the additional include directories and
- additional library directories to point at the folders on your system. Do not forget to paste the assimp.dll
- and SDL2.dll to the project base directory as well.
```

Makma is a Vulkan benchmark. It features a four-pass deferred renderer, cascaded shadow mapping, metal/roughness material setup, volumetric lighting, bloom, directional, point and spotlights, in-depth performance graphs (per pass) and a large options menu to customize the benchmark.
